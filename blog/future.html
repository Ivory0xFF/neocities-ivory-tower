			<h1>Future of the blog</h1>
			<p>
				&emsp;I want to write more. Text is a really good interface for information and I want to get better at translating the abstract into proper words. I have enough things to talk about but without structure there's no point in talking about them since the recipient won't gain much from it. By writing from time to time I both get to maybe show someone something I think is cool and get better at explaining and structuring thoughts for others to read.
				<br><br>
				&emsp;It's already been a month since I made the last article which I consider to be the first serious text I wrote here. I'll come back to write about different projects and concepts though I don't know how often. Either way this site mostly describes itself instead of being a platform besides the portfolio and it really needs more stuff in it.
