~~This site's a bit of a mess since most code is minified so read at your own risk~~

^ This is no longer the case! (do note that the .js files are basically obfuscated to save up a bit of space, but some may be commented (also, the entirety of style.css is comprised of one line long classes and stuff since I got used to writing css like that))

The actual code that I upload to the site is minified first, so I wanted to make this public for others to be able to see the code prettified and stuff. * Some files (or entire folders, such as "HD assets"/) are not actually uploaded to the site at all!

So uh... overall? Read the code if you wanna, I guess? Just don't sell the assets (the stuff in assets/ and "HD assets"/), as I'd like them to be merely available in the repo without being redistributable

## bit of "documentation"
the color palette is in the first line in /style.css
pcol is the primary color, scol the secondary color, and tcol is basically pcol but transparent
