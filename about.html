<p><img src=assets/Bemd.png style=width:7em;float:left;margin-right:1em class=bordr>Hello hi, I program stuff from time to time and model/draw! I'm also learning a bit of simplified anatomy, godot and krita<br><br>Basically I discovered a lot of the things I like around 2020 (Blender and programming in general) but I've picked up drawing recently and have been more serious this time instead of just doodling things. I made this site in december 2022 after putting it off for a while and come back from time to time to update it<br><br>I made it without any frameworks n stuff and used the neocities editor for a good few months before finally switching to vscode (which is way better-- use the live server extension to host the site locally on a port if you plan on switching too)</p>
