			<h2>Me</h2>
			<p>Hello hi! I program, model and draw things<br><br>I just make stuff and eventually upload it here<br><br> I'm <strong>ivoreh</strong> on discord</p>
			<h2>The site</h2>
			<p>I made this site in december 2022 after putting it off for a while and come back from time to time to update it<br><br>I made it without any frameworks n stuff (except three.js which is loaded through a cdn) and used the neocities editor for a good few months before finally switching to vscode (which is way better-- use the live server extension to host the site locally on a port if you plan on switching too (or maybe nginx))<br><br>I try to keep it small, each <code>.html</code>, <code>.js</code> and <code>.css</code> file being under 5kb. I also add different things (as an example, around the middle of march 2024, I updated a js script to let me link images from the portfolio directly with anchor links)<br><br>I don't really post anywhere except here so if you've somehow found this you're one of the few thousand people who have seen it up until now! (apparently 9,308 on the 22nd of March 2024, according to neocities (update: 10k since sometime during the 18th of May!))</p>
