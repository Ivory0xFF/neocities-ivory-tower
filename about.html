				<h2>Me</h2>
				<p>Hello hi! I program, model and draw things<br><br>I just make them and eventually upload them here if I deem them good enough / worthy of being seen by others</p>
				<h2>The site</h2>
				<p>I made this site in december 2022 after putting it off for a while and come back from time to time to update it<br><br>I made it without any frameworks n stuff (except three.js which is loaded through a cdn) and used the neocities editor for a good few months before finally switching to vscode (which is way better-- use the live server extension to host the site locally on a port if you plan on switching too (or maybe nginx))<br><br>I try to keep it small, each <code>.html .js</code> and <code>.css</code> file being under 5kb. I also add different things (as an example, around the middle of march 2024, I updated a js script to let me link images from the portfolio directly with anchor links)<br><br>I don't really post anywhere except here so if you've somehow found this you're one of the few thousand people (apparently 9,308 on the 22nd of March 2024, according to neocities (update: 10k since sometime during the 18th of May!)) who have seen it up until now!</p>
